In particular, the spoken dialogue is analyzed and correlated with associated text extracted from the video; the identity and number of speakers in the scenes is established by using speaker recognition and face tracking algorithms. <br /><br />HARR (Human Activity Representation and Recognition) project has developed robust algorithms for human detection, tracking and motion direction estimation and, is currently developing ""motion units"" and grammar based activity representation and recognition algorithms. <br /><br />AISS (Autonomous Intelligent Surveillance System) Research Program aims to develop an adaptive and reconfigurable security surveillance system capable of exploiting environmental information and knowledge base. The system provides continuous detection, tracking and recognition of all human activities within the scene to generate person-specific surveillance report. The program consists of several key enabling projects: multi-modal biometrics, human activity representation and recognition, semantic scene description and representation. <br /><br />MUMOBIO (Multi-modal Biometric) Program is developing a continuous human recognition system using gait, face, voice and fingerprint modalities. The system is integrated with the HARR project to enable person-specific surveillance. In addition, the project is addressing the security issues of traditional pattern recognition based biometric systems by developing schemes to bind effectively and efficiently multimodal biometrics with cryptographic keys to form crypto-biometrics systems. <br /><br />The Multimedia ""Search n Retrieve"" Research Program aims to develop methods and tools that can be used in a rapid application development (RAD) environment for multimedia browse, search, and retrieve systems. The systems will employ a multi-modal approach involving, voice, image and video features, text and human cognition.<br /><br />RIWD (Robust Image Watermarking Decoding) Project aims to develop a robust decoding method for commonly adopted image watermarking schemes such as Spread Spectrum (SS) and Quantization Index Modulation (QIM).

She writes on contemporary art and media with a particular concern for the diverse ways that artists negotiate the ecological and social transformations of the twenty-first century. Recent publications have focused on artistic and other cultural manifestations of species extinctions, natural disaster, geology and landscape in the Anthropocene, and the question of the machine in cultural practices. From 2014 to 2017 she was the convener of MECO: The Material Ecologies Research Network [ link: https://www.uowblogs.com/meco/ ], and she continues to work in interdisciplinary teams examining the relationships between art, writing and the Anthropocene.

This include i) the design of synthetic population generators to build a disagregated database of the system&rsquo;s entities; and ii) the development of microsimulations to simulate and observe the agents&rsquo; behaviour. Applications of this work include transportation modelling and disease spreading which can involve millions of agents. The research is interdisciplinary and requires methods from applied mathematics, statistics and high performance scientific programming.</p>

https://scholars.uow.edu.au/display//flynn_hill,"Hill, Flynn R.",flynn,"<p>In my PhD research, I used X-ray and neutron scattering to determine the shapes and dynamics of motion of enzymes that interact with DNA. As a postdoctoral researcher, I went on to&nbsp;use single-molecule microscopy to track the individual trajectories of motion of populations of tens of thousands of DNA-interacting enzymes. From this, I developed an interest in the methods and algorithms for characterising the diversity present within a population ensemble, given information on its individual members. I am now applying these skills in the field of learning analytics, where large, information rich datasets on individual student learning behaviour and academic outcomes allow us to characterise the diversity of learning styles present within the student population. Particular interests of mine include the use of machine learning to predict student behaviour and outcomes, and challenge of measuring the effects of treatments and interventions in education given only correlational data.</p>",,

<p>My research focuses on the intersection of climate change knowledge and household behaviours. It investigates why increasing awareness and knowledge of the impact of climate change has not significantly altered domestic household practices especially in the light of modes of personal mobility. I explore the connections between identity, mobility, place and sustainable practices by attending to the embodied dimensions of mobility and in particular, affective and emotional relationships that people have with their cars. My interest in how novel participatory and mobile methodologies can engage participants in collaborative and creative explorations of meaning and connection to place has drawn on, performative, affect-based, non-representational geographies. As such I am interested in sensory methods which pay attention to sound, touch, taste, smell and texture.</p>
<p>My interest in creative research methodologies is underpinned by the desire to critically engage with contemporary debates about the environmental sustainability. Currently sonic methods are underutilised as a sensory methodology. Sonic methodologies work on the assumption that while sounds are coded within particular ideologies, the processes of hearing and listening are embodied and therefore do not work to a given script or preconfigured world. More than simply representing places, communities or identities, everyday sounds (including music) give insights into how connections (or disconnections) in and to place, are mediated by emotional and affective relationships. This approach moves beyond sound as representation to explore sound as a process.</p>",

<p>Ω <i>Lithium-, sodium, potassium-ion rechargeable battery research and development</i></p>
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>The working principle of a metal-ion rechargeable battery is to store energy in chemical form by using charge-balancing metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+, etc.) that reversibly insert into the electrodes. The structure and chemistry of the electrodes determines their functional mechanism and the removal and insertion of Li ions can significantly affect structure. Consequently, the structure and phase evolution of electrodes during battery charge and discharge can be complex, with these processes underpinning function and electrochemical performance of the whole battery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both X-ray (including synchrotron) and neutron techniques are important and have been widely used for the mechanistic study. In particular, neutron scattering provides a suitable elemental contrast (e.g. high sensitive to Li and O), relatively-large penetration depth, and non-destructive interaction with matter, coupling with the fast-detection ability of modern instrumentation to enable neutron powder diffraction to probe, in real time, the bulk crystallographic changes of electrodes in functioning batteries, with such experimental approaches known as operando studies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Structure-property relations are central to understanding functional materials, &nbsp;where marrying battery electrochemistry and materials crystallography is critically useful, but also challenging. A mechanistic understanding of the reaction pathways, i.e. the atomistic and molecular-scale origin of battery performance, will enable the rational improvement of electrode materials and pave the way for entirely new battery systems.</p>

<p><strong>Current research projects</strong></p>
<p>Until 2015, I was a node leader in the Marie Curie &lsquo;Towards an Embodied Science of Intersubjectivity&rsquo; initial training network (2011-2015). I have also been an active collaborator in the 'Agency, Normativity and Identity' project (2012-2015) funded by the Spanish Ministry of Innovation and Research.</p>
<p>In other upcoming projects I aim to explore how we can, and why we must, understand the foundations of sciences of the of mind in enactive, embodied terms. Along with Glenda Satne, I am also continuing to investigate the question of contentful thought arises and how it is scaffolded by socio-cultural practices.</p>
<p>With an eye on non-academic impact, I am also working on a new book, commissioned by Bloomsbury. It targets a general audience and spells out why clarifying issues in the philosophy of psychology matters crucially to our understanding of and ability to make good decisions about: education; animal welfare; psychopathology; therapy and sports science.</p>",

<p>Barbara (BSc Hons, PhD) was educated at Monash University in Melbourne Victoria, graduating with her PhD in 1993 and has since worked at the University of Wollongong.</p>
<p><strong>Research Focus</strong></p>
<p>The primary focus of Barbara&rsquo;s research is in the area of lipids and fatty acid metabolism, most notably the health benefits of omega-3 fats - some examples of research impact.</p>
<p>Omega-3s and recommended intakes</p>
<p>Barbara&rsquo;s highest cited 2003 publication with 299 citations (1) was the catalyst for informing the Australian Government&rsquo;s National Health &amp; Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Nutrient Reference Values for dietary intakes of omega-3 fats. Australians are still not consuming the amount of omega-3 fats for optimal health (2). Barbara has recently been selected to be part of the Australian delegation to 39<sup>th</sup> Session of the Codex Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses to be held in Berlin, Germany from 4-8 December 2017 to try and reach a global consensus on recommended intakes for omega-3 fat.</p>
<p>Omega-3 and pregnancy</p>
<p>Barbara through her collaboration with long term colleague, Dr Dilys Freeman from the University of Glasgow, has shown:</p>
<p>i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That there is reduced transfer of omega-3 fats to the fetus in women suffering from pre-eclampsia and intra-uterine growth restriction (3);</p>
<p>ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the omega-3 fats get stuck in the placenta (4) and that may help explain why omega-3 supplementation does not ameliorate pre-eclampsia;</p>
<p>iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Omega-3 fats are extremely important for the formation of the neural tube (the backbone) (5).</p>
<p>Both Universities have recognised this work as both are Honorary Fellows from the respective Universities. Also, recipients of the Vice Chancellor&rsquo;s Visiting International Scholar Award (VISA) in 2016.</p>
<p>Omega-3 and mental health</p>
<p>Together with colleagues from UOW and Universities of South Australia, NSW, Newcastle, NHMRC Partnership Grant (APP1113396), Does Omega-3 Supplementation Attenuate Aggressive Behaviour: A Multi-Centre Randomised Controlled Trial of a Broadly Disseminable Strategy 2016-2020. $1,809,278 ($964,000 partners; $845,278 NHMRC).</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this research will have huge impact in terms of reduced aggressive behaviour through omega-3 supplementation. As this is a partnership grant, the results will inform policy and practice.</p>
<p><strong>Awards</strong></p>
<p>Nutrition Society of Australia (NSA) Medal Award in 2016.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The NSA Medal may be awarded to members who are Australian nutrition scientists with an outstanding track record in the field of animal or human nutrition, with the work carried out predominantly in Australia (permanent residents are eligible to apply) and who is currently highly active in his/her field of endeavour.</p>
<p>No more than one NSA Medal shall be awarded in any one year.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Research Communication</strong></p>

<strong> Estuaries of southeastern Australia</strong>
<p>The estuaries of southeastern Australia are a research focus of the GeoQuEST Research Centre. Colin Woodroffe is part of a team of researchers examining the processes by which coastal lakes and barrier estuaries infill. His particular focus has been on the stratigraphy of mature infilled barrier estuaries such as the Shoalhaven River delta (Woodroffe et al., 2000, Umitsu et al., 2001), and the Minnamurra River plains (Panayotou et al., 2007; Haslett et al., 2010). He is collaborating with Dr Kerrylee Rogers (Future Fellow) to examine the vulnerability of estuaries to environmental change, as part of an ARC Linkage project with researchers from ANSTO, OEH, and Shoalhaven and Bega Councils. Preliminary results include modelling of mangrove and saltmarsh dynamics and sedimentation in the Minnamurra estuary (Oliver et al., 2012) and consideration of carbon storage in these systems (Saintilan et al., 2013).</p>

<strong> Estuaries of northern Australia</strong>
<p>Colin Woodroffe&rsquo;s research in northern Australia has led to the development of a three-stage model of estuarine evolution based on the coring, stratigraphy and dating results from the South Alligator River, but with supporting evidence from other adjacent river systems (Woodroffe et al., 1993). The initial stage, commencing around 8000 years ago, was a transgressive stage during which the valleys were flooded as sea level continued to rise. The second stage during the mid-Holocene, termed a big swamp phase, was characterised by widespread mangrove forests occupying much of what is now estuarine plain. This phase peaked around 6000 years ago, when sea level stabilised at or close to its present level. This stage was superseded by the final stage during which the estuary became channelised as vertical sedimentation continued to infill the estuary, and mangroves were replaced by sedge/grassland.</p>
<p>A particular area of interest in these northern Australian systems is the rapid recent expansion of several of the tidal system, particularly that on the Mary River. Extensive areas of the low-lying plains have undergone saline intrusion, and this appears to be an analogue of the way in which low-lying plains elsewhere might be inundated under conditions of sea-level rise as anticipated as a result of climate change (Mulrennan and Woodroffe, 1998). These systems, together with a tidal creek in NSW, were the focus of research by Gareth Davies for his PhD.</p>

<p>The pattern of development of estuaries identified in northern Australia, with a change from transgression to regression, has been identified throughout much of the southeast Asian region, although many of the larger deltaic systems have filled in more rapidly and their shoreline may have prograded more extensively (Woodroffe, 2000).&nbsp; Colin is interested in developing the approaches adopted in northern Australia and extending them to the delta systems of southeast Asia (Woodroffe, et al., 2006), and supervised a project on the Bangladesh coast undertaken by Sarwar for a PhD.

My scholarly writing reflects the lessons I have learned, informed by my research data and professional practice. I have presented papers internationally, providing opportunities to discuss emerging issues with my peers, receive feedback, and promote collaboration with other experts in my field. Similarly, at the local level, my active involvement in visiting public schools enables me to identify what is &lsquo;best demonstrated practice&rsquo; with a view to including this in my teaching (Korthagen, 2010).&nbsp;</p>
<p>My goal of developing a Community of Practice with my students and colleagues is furthered by scaffolding my students to understand how to become researchers themselves (Keegan, 2016). The outcome of this is that I have been actively involved in creating new subjects in our degree: <i>Professional Studies: The teacher as a managing professional</i> and <i>Professional Studies: The teacher as a researcher</i>. The second of these helps students understand how research influences teaching, particularly action-research in the classroom.</p>

The capacity to locate, read and critically engage with research is a core professional attribute...

She teaches and researches in the areas of critical legal theory, law and history, race, gender, sexuality and the law, and securities regulation. Nan has published in refereed law journals and book collections in England, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nan has been a Visiting Scholar at the University of California, Berkeley Law Center for the Study of Law and Society, a resident fellow at the University of California Humanities Research Institute and a visitor at the University of Kent Centre for Law, Gender and Sexuality, as well a number of other Research Centres. She has been on teams successful in attracting grants from public funders such as the National Bank of Australia, the New Zealand Fund for Science Research and Technology, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and others. The analysis of gender, race, sexuality and the law has been the focus of her work in a number of international projects, including at Monash University and the Onati International Institute for the Sociology of Law. She has also been the recipient of research funding from the New Zealand Legal Services Board and the JR McKenzie Foundation.</p>
<p>As Director of the Legal Intersections Research Centre Nan has oversight of an active program of seminars, symposia, visiting scholars and early career researcher and graduate student mentoring and other programs.&nbsp; She also leads a range of collaborative research and community projects.&nbsp;<br /><br />Nan is on the editorial and advisory boards of <i>Law and Literature</i>, <i>Law Text Culture</i>, <i>Feminist Legal Studies</i>, the Routledge book series <i>Laws of the Postcolonial: Ethics and Economy</i>, <i>Australian Feminist Studies</i> and the Centre for Feminist Legal Studies at the University of British Columbia.</p>
<p>Professor Seuffert is an elected member of the University of Wollongong Council, the Unisuper Consultative Committee and the UOW Senate.&nbsp; She also serves on the Faculty of Law, Humanity and the Arts Research Committee, the Law School Leadership Team and the School of Law Research Advisory Group.&nbsp; Prior to joining the Faculty of Law at Wollongong, as Professor at the University of Waikato in New Zealand, Nan held a number of Faculty and University administrative and management roles, including Acting Dean, Acting Associate Dean, Acting Deputy Dean, Associate Dean Research and Graduate, Director of Graduate Programmes, Director of Undergraduate Programmes and Director of International Relations.

It aims to study how contract law and its associated ideas,&nbsp;such as individualism, freedom and consent, developed in those societies, and became integral to what it&nbsp;means to be an &lsquo;Australian&rsquo; or a &lsquo;New Zealander&rsquo; today. Signficantly, it places this history within a&nbsp;transnational perspective, analysing how contract laws and ideas circulated among settler colonial societies&nbsp;in the British Empire. The resulting book and other scholarly publications will highlight complex exchanges&nbsp;across colonial sites, rather than movement from the centre to periphery.</p>
<p>As the Director of LIRC Nan leads four collaborative research and community projects. With Dr Trish Mundy, in partnership with the YWCA of NSW, she in conducting the YWCA Domestic Violence Intervention Service (DVIS) Evaluation, which is externally funded by a National Australia Bank Community Impact Grant. The project has developed and applied &lsquo;best practice methodologies&rsquo; for evaluating integrated domestic violence service provision. A pilot project, also with Dr Trish Mundy, in partnership with the Women Lawyers Association of NSW (WLANSW) is focused on documenting best practices for the advancement of women in law firms. Nan spoke about the project at Ashurst law firm in 2016, and the project report was launched by the Honourable Acting Justice Jane Mathews AO and the WLANSW in September 2017. She is also leading a project on &lsquo;LLB Curriculum Innovation: UOW Law at the Leading Edge&rsquo; which includes seven LIRC members and investigates innovative methods and pedagogies, including cutting edge technology, for LLB teaching that maintains UOW Law&rsquo;s award winning student-centred curriculum and pedagogy, and student success.

https://scholars.uow.edu.au/display//siobhan_mchugh,"McHugh, Siobhan A.",smchugh,"McHugh's research examines the aesthetics and impact of crafted audio storytelling and podcasts as a distinctive and rapidly evolving media format. Her research is also concerned with the power of sound, the production of intimacy and the transformations of voice achieved when oral history and journalism are creatively adapted for an aural format, such as a documentary or podcast. She is Founding Editor of RadioDoc Review, an open access journal that brings together scholars, practitioners and industry figures to develop in-depth critical analysis of the audio documentary/feature form, now commonly disseminated as podcast. RadioDoc Review was singled out by Emer Prof Michele Hilmes in a plenary address at the Radio Preservation Task Force Conference (US Library of Congress 2-4 Nov 2017) as a model example of how interdisciplinary academic pursuits can connect with larger, popular audiences. McHugh's practice-based Non-Traditional Research Outputs (NTROs), major creative works produced as radio documentaries and podcasts, have had significant impact and won international awards. She is currently second CI on an ARC Discovery project which uses oral history and aurality to examine Aboriginal art from the transcultural perspectives of its producers and via recent globalised contemporary art practices.&nbsp;","Dr McHugh is second CI on an ARC Discovery Grant, A New Theory of Aboriginal Art, led by art historian and senior research professor, Ian McLean. The project Partner Investigator is Margo Neale, Senior Indigenous Curator at the National Museum of Australia and curator of their current major exhibition, Songlines: Tracking The Seven Sisters. This ARC project (2015-17) investigates the significant but poorly documented relationships that inform the production of Aboriginal art.&nbsp;We examine, for the&nbsp;first time, how collective and transcultural aspects of Aboriginal art production function within a contemporary art context. We ask if the collective nature of many contemporary Aboriginal&nbsp;productions, in both urban and remote zones, can be interpreted in terms of post-conceptual and&nbsp;relational, and if they offer a better explanation of how Aboriginal artists engaged with&nbsp;modernity than the paradigm of modernism?&nbsp;Aboriginal art has not gained access to&nbsp;the lucrative international art market because it is not being seen as relevant to contemporary art. Our aim is to&nbsp;re-evaluate Aboriginal art practices from the contemporary art perspective of&nbsp;relational art and transculturalism&nbsp;and thereby revive an industry that while well&nbsp;established currently lacks ideas to take full advantage of the global art world economy.<br /><br />Our focus is on two remote Aboriginal communities, the Buku-Larrnyggay Mulka art centre in Yirrkala in North-East Arnhem Land and Warlukurlangu centre in Yuendemu, c. 300 kilometres north-west of Alice Springs. We will also examine the urban Indigenous art movement, Proppa Now, in Brisbane. Fieldwork is now almost complete (October 2017). McHugh has recorded 35 oral history interviews with Indigenous artists, art centre staff (mostly non-Indigenous), gallerists, curators and others, and archival research has been undertaken on location. The oral histories will be preserved as a research collection and drawn on by McHugh as an aural resource to make a high-impact, accessible radio documentary. This has been commissioned by ABC Radio National in what following funding cuts has become a highly competitive process. It is scheduled for broadcast in 2018. McHugh and McLean will also co-author scholarly articles on their innovative collaboration.<br /><br />In other research, McHugh is examining transformations within the media landscape&nbsp;wrought by the rise of podcasting. This is evident in existing media organisations, from the New York Times (whose The Daily podcast garnered 750,000 subscribers in six months) to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, as they adapt content to take advantage of the intimacy and reach of the podcast format. With UOW Research Fellow Julie Posetti, McHugh has made an ethnographic study of the transformations of a major Australian newsroom, The Age, that occurred in the making of the successful podcast Phoebe's Fall (2016), on which McHugh was consulting producer. She is also piloting a Hub for Innovation in Podcasting (HIP), a proposed one-stop shop that will teach, research, produce and curate podcasts from the academic, institutional and community sectors. To this end she has engaged as an invited expert with the Committee to Protect Journalists (US), Rutas del Conflicto (Colombia), the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union, the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS),&nbsp;the Australian War Memorial&nbsp;and the Oral History Association of Australia. HIP was shortlisted through two rounds of the Walkley Media Incubator and Innovation Fund in 2017.","Audio storytelling, oral history, podcasting, radio documentary, affect, emotions"

<p>His main research focus is to combine bio and synthetic polymers with carbon nanostructures, and/or conducting polymers via processing techniques such as additive fabrication into soft (wet and tough) materials for water treatment, soft robotics, bionics and tissue engineering applications. Since moving to the University of Wollongong in 2006, Prof. in het Panhuis has focussed his research on hydrogels (based on biopolymers such as gellan gum), their mechanical and electrical characterisation, and processing using Additive Manufacturing (3D/4D printing). More recent research has involved developing materials and processes for edible electronics, and fins for surfboards.</p>
<p>Understanding the characteristics of materials and their importance in processing and materials fabrication has enabled his group to make a number of breakthroughs in: (i) the processing of conducting materials (including printing of devices), (ii) the synthesis of a new type of tough hydrogel (including 3D printing), (iii) the development of bio-inks for printing living cells, (iv) application of 4D printing to develop an autonomously functioning valve, (v) development of hydrogel materials for edible electronics and (vi) use of 3D printing in the development of fins for surfboards.</p>
<p><strong><i>3D Printed Fins for Surfboards</i></strong> is an innovative interdisciplinary research project proving that, compared to traditional manufacturing, 3D printing is a viable alternative to customise and rapidly propotype surfboard fins. The project brings together experienced experts and early career researchers from a diverse range of disciplines including materials science, human geography, engineering, biomechanics, 3D printing, computational fluid dynamics, the Internet-of-Things, data mining and surfing. This project owes its success to its truly interdisciplinary nature, see <a href=""https://goo.gl/J1d5mB"">https://goo.gl/J1d5mB</a>.</p>
<p><br /> The research conducted by in het Panhuis has received significant media attention. His &lsquo;Hydrogel Scaffolds&rsquo; invention won the People&rsquo;s Choice award on ABC TV&rsquo;s The New Inventors in 2009. He was featured on BBC television for his work on 4D printing in 2015. Since 2016, his work on 3D printed fins for surfboards has been regularly appearing in the media, e.g. The Australian, 9NewsIllawarra, ABC radio and on Discovery Channel program Daily Planet (to name by a few).&nbsp;For more details see: <a href=""https://goo.gl/QVga7q"">https://goo.gl/QVga7q</a></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Household Sustainability:</strong> This work explores the question: Who is doing the work of household sustainability? I explore this question through investigating who is involved in various everyday practices including driving, preparing meals, preserving food and making decisions about what is and is not rubbish. Everyday mundane practices are repositioned as key in household sustainability debates.</li>
<li><strong>Fuel Poverty:</strong> Key to this work is the question: What can we learn from older low income household to address fuel poverty? Rather than positioning people as a problem that has to be fixed through energy efficiency policies, this project starts with the assumption that people are part of the solution to fuel poverty. Hence, the aim of this work is to better understand how energy is used to make places called home. Equipped with this knowledge, policy makers can more informed energy policies.</li>
<li><strong>Urban Revitalisation:</strong> The starting point for this research is the question: How can we make regional city centre more lively places? This project sits with wider concerns that not everybody has equal access to city centres. Attention turns to how different process of discrimination and marginalisation operate through impressions, transport modes and routes or pathways. </li>

<p><strong>Current research projects:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Protecting the Internally Displaced: Rhetoric and Reality&nbsp;</strong>(forthcoming, Routledge) examines how the emergence of IDP protection as an international issue in the past twenty years has challenged basic understandings around similar issues, including refugee protection, migration, humanitarianism, and international humanitarian and human rights law. The book examines these issues as separate regimes, and uses theories of regime complexity to explore how the emergence of the internally displaced persons protection regime over the past twenty years has interacted, transformed, and undermined other existing regimes.</p>
<p><strong>Improving the International Response to Regime-Induced Displacement</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; this ARC Discovery funded project (DP150102453) examines why governments increasingly use force to deliberately displace their own populations on a massive scale, which is termed regime-induced displacement. Through a mix of quantitative and case study research, this project explains why such actions have become rational strategies for regimes to respond to ethnic groups which may be a threat to them and how these regimes try to justify their behaviour in order to thwart or delay international action. This is a critical issue as beyond its human cost, regime-induced displacement can lead to state fragility and regional instability as cases from Darfur to Syria demonstrate.</p>",

<p>My research (and teaching) engages with human-nature relationships. I have completed extensive research on shared governance arrangements between government conservation agencies and Indigenous communities in national parks and World Heritage Areas, including direct contributions to policy development. Other research has examined Indigenous and local knowledge systems and how these interact with Western knowledge frameworks, as well as the cultural dimensions of hunting, especially around knowledge, respect and sacredness. My current research examines freediving as a means of relationship with our Blue Planet. I am also interested in the theory and practice of transformational learning experiences.</p>
<p>Methodologically, I like &lsquo;full-immersion fieldwork&rsquo;, getting deeply and actively involved in the human and non-human lives and landscapes I research. I have worked with Indigenous and other communities across Australia, in arctic Scandinavia, Indonesia, the United States and in India. Prior to joining academia, I have 20 years of professional experience that integrates teaching, research, professional and community roles. I have worked for community-based organisations, NGOs, government agencies, Indigenous organisations, and as a consultant. This experience continues to facilitate strong industry and community linkages that benefit both teaching and research.</p>",

Currently I am interested in how development, in children and elders, modulates the visual sampling strategies depending on experience with the task and executive functioning. This line of research has a special emphasis on pedestrian safety. I develop and use innovative gaze-contingent techniques to precisely isolate visual diagnostic information during a wide range of lab and realistic tasks (face processing, reading, road-crossing etc). I also develop novel analysis techniques and reconstruction methods for a precise delineation of perception-action coordination.

<p>I am an urban political geographer. My major interests revolve, broadly, around critical studies of urban governance, its changing geographies, material practices and politics, and the differential implications for urban places, communities, subjectivities and power. My work draws broadly on post-structural political economy approaches that seek to combine critical and generative orientations. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A major strand of my work has been concerned to analyse the changing geographies and practices of neoliberalised urban governance. &nbsp;Resisting universalized accounts, I have sought to unpack urban neoliberalism as a political project that is contingently performed and unevenly reproduced in diverse contexts. Empirically, I have developed this analysis through explorations of urban entrepreneurialism, competitive urbanism, the private governance of urban neighbourhoods and, most recently, urban regeneration.</p>
<p>A second strand of my research centres on the strategic role of cities in climate governance and low carbon urban transitions, especially around energy. I have explored the evolution of the urban governance of carbon in Australian cities&mdash;across an array of state and non-state actors working across multiple scales&mdash;teasing out its modes, practices, and political implications. In related work on urban energy transitions, I am tracing how these transitions are being assembled, re-routing flows of resources and reconfiguring urban political interests as they unfold.</p>
<p>I am also increasingly interested in analysing the emergent urban geographies and governance of &lsquo;smart cities&rsquo; and &lsquo;sharing cities&rsquo;. As forms of urban governance, both smart and sharing are underpinned by technological platforms, combine progressive and regressive potentials, and are likely to drive a host of urban economic, socio-spatial and political transformations. I aim to think critically and generatively about the urban politics of &lsquo;smart&rsquo; and &lsquo;sharing&rsquo;, their promise and their peril in future work. &nbsp;</p>",

He is also an Adjunct in the School of Psychology and active contributor to Early Start's research agenda.</p>
<p>Dr Howard's program of research investigates children&rsquo;s developing self-regulation and related abilities (e.g., executive functions, school readiness), and the real-world implications of these changing abilities. This includes creating low-cost and accessible means for those who routinely work with young children to measure and positively influence children&rsquo;s development and outcomes in these areas.</p>
<p>He has published more than 30 research articles and multiple academic texts, and has led or been part of teams that have attracted more than $4.5 million in research funding (e.g., ARC DECRA, NHMRC Project Grant, competitive Government tender).

His contributions to practice include co-creation of the internationally adopted <em>Early Years Toolbox</em> to assess children's cognitive, social, self-regulatory, numeracy and language development (currently in use in 5 continents, in research and educational contexts). He has also created 4 children's books with embedded cognitive activities as a low-cost, evidence-based means for parents and educators to engage and enhance young children's self-regulation (i.e., Quincey Quokka's Quest; I Don't Miss the Shopping List; Polly and her Lolly; The Pear that wasn't There).<br /><br />As of 2018, he has 11 current PhD students and 6 PhD completions.","Self-regulation, executive function, school readiness, preschool, early years, early assessment, cognitive development"

I am also interested in how these processes can drive evolutionary changes in organisms. My research, therefore, involves a mixture of specialisations. This more often than not involves mapping and sampling campaigns in remote regions (e.g. West Papua, the Himalaya) to document the relative timing of magmatic, metamorphic and deformation events. I then use biostratigraphic and isotopic data to determine when these events occurred in the geological record. I am also interested in hydrocarbon exploration, investigating large-scale structural controls on gold and copper mineralisation, diamond exploration and the development of methodologies for isotopic dating.

<p>- Industrial cities and workplaces</p>
<p>- Geographical political economy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Ethnography<br /><br /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an economic geographer interested in the lived experiences of work and employment within industries, and communities, undergoing technological, structural and spatial transformations. My research is empirically grounded and informed by a geographical political economy (GPE) approach, which provides a theoretical framework to interpret local experiences of economic transition as outcomes of wider forces of capital mobility, state intervention, and structural change. My published work draws from in-depth case studies to understand wider issues, processes, and developments. Empirical research often involves longitudinal ethnographic methods deployed within workplaces (broadly defined).</p>

<p><strong>Current Research Projects</strong></p>
<p>&lsquo;<strong><i>Economic Geographies of Transition in Australia&rsquo;s Auto Repair and Maintenance industry</i></strong>&rsquo; (ARC DECRA project, 2018-2020)</p>
<p>In 2017 the last new passenger vehicle rolled-off a production line at GM-Holden&rsquo;s Elizabeth plant symbolising the end of Australia&rsquo;s auto manufacturing industry. Joining the geographical re-organisation of upstream vehicle production has been the downstream transformation of auto repair and maintenance services. Combining a comprehensive survey and ethnographic methods this project is tracing the structural changes in Australia&rsquo;s downstream auto industry and documenting experiences of transition in affected local workshops. A GPE framework is being used to interpret new technical and competitive dynamics among local auto repair and maintenance firms, and examine changing knowledge and skill requirements among a diverse workforce. It is hoped that results from the project will provide a robust evidence-base to support policy and worker training aimed at securing Australia's industrial future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>Labour geographies and experiences of workplace restructuring</i></strong></p>
<p>I have an ongoing research interest in people&rsquo;s lived experiences of contemporary workplace restructuring. Informed by debates in labour geographies, and labour studies more broadly, around the political potential of working people my research explores how major restructuring episodes impact workplaces and labour processes (the social and technical relations of production). Among other things, results of my research emphasise the political salience of intra-worker relationships, which play a powerful role shaping day-to-day experiences of work including opportunities, actions, and outcomes of turbulent events such as workplace restructuring. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><i>&nbsp;</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Commodity production and material resources</i></strong></p>
In collaboration with Prof Chris Gibson (UOW), I am also involved in a project seeking to better understand the changing socio-spatial relationships between manufacturing industries and the material resources final commodities are made from. One of our case studies is the acoustic guitar industry. Traditionally guitar production has depended on the supply of timber from a select range of trees e.g. spruce, rosewood, ebony, and mahogany. But as these &lsquo;staple&rsquo; timbers have become increasingly scarce and their trade more regulated, guitar manufacturers have been compelled to incorporate alternative timbers and materials. Through our research, we have documented how manufacturers transition to more sustainable use of material resources; a process stretching from trees to final consumers (musicians). The research has also demonstrated the commercial importance of 'material knowledge' developed around timbers by workers in the guitar industry who ensure valuable resources are utilised productively. Such embodied skills and practices, we argue, are crucial for a future where society must learn to do more with less.",

I conduct value-based social research to explore health policy problems and inform policy processes. Research interests include: human-animal health interactions; the politics and ethics of infectious disease control; and, the influence of technologies and systems on medical reasoning and public health decision making.<br /><br />Empirically, my work explores the values and interests of those with a stake in these areas of science and practice. Methodologically, I have developed extensive expertise in deliberative methods, Delphi techniques, qualitative research and applied ethics. My published work draws on empirical case studies or explores conceptual and theoretical issues. Recent work has focused on two broad research areas:<br /><ol>
<li>social processes and the construction and use of evidence in public health policy and clinical governance</li>
<li>how we conceptualize and seek to manage health at the human-animal-environment interface.&nbsp;</li>

Her book, <i>Masters and Servants: Cultures of Empire in the Tropics, 1880-1930, </i>was published by Manchester University Press in 2016. The book explores the emergence of a shared colonial culture of domestic service in Singapore and Darwin. Claire shows how this shared culture was forged through the exchange of ideas, people and trade between the port cities and was marked the common preference for employing Chinese &lsquo;houseboys&rsquo; in the homes of British and white Australian colonists.</p>
<p>Claire undertook further research on the culture of &lsquo;houseboys&rsquo; and colonialism in the tropics as part of a collaborative ARC Discovery Project based at the University of Wollongong with Julia Martinez, Frances Steel and Victoria Haskins. She is a co-editor (with Haskins) of a volume on <i>Colonization and Domestic Service: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives</i> (Routledge, New York, 2015) Claire has published her work in <i>Modern Asian Studies</i>, <i>The Pacific Historical Review</i>, <i>Gender and History</i>, <i>The Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History</i> and <i>History Australia.</i></p>",

Dionigi has built a strong relationship with the industry as he is currently associated with one of the largest research centres in Australia, the Capital Market Cooperative Research Centre (CMCRC), which sponsors one of my PhD Students that work mainly in the Microstructure area (recently he submitted his thesis).&nbsp;</p>","<p>Dionigi is also a research fellow at The Financial Markets Research Centre (at the Australian Securities Exchange), where he has access to a unique set of data, fundamental to his research. These collaborations facilitated the completion of Dionigi&rsquo;s ARC Linkage Grant project he was awarded in 2009 and linked him to the Funds Management industry (Regal Funds Sydney), employing two PhD Students (both of them completed their PhD). To ensure success, Dionigi selects the top students in the finance area and offers them scholarships linked with these industries with the intent of working on issues that they face on a daily basis which returns positive value to his research profile, while the students get skilled both on an industry/academic basis. This model enabled Dionigi to produce two publications in tier 1 journals, Journal of Banking and Finance, Accounting and Finance and ABACUS, respectively. Since 2006 Dionigi achieved a total of 21 publications. His research outcomes were fostered by both national and international academic collaborations, involving academics from various Universities (Prof Alex Frino from MGSM, Prof Riccardo Palumbo from the University of Chieti-Pescara (Italy), Prof Marco Pagano from the University of Naples (Italy), and As. Prof Maurizio Larocca from the University of Calabria (Italy)).</p>
<p>Dionigi is actively involved in the supervision of both PhD and Honour students on projects involving both his industry and academics collaboration. These projects relate on ""improving the accuracy of analyst consensus forecasting"", ""analysing the determinants of value investing in the Asia-Pacific Markets"", &ldquo;testing the intraday Price Formation in Index CFD's&rdquo; and ""testing the impact of international financial reporting standards on liquidity components"". &nbsp;Dionigi has successfully supervised 2 PhD students to completion, all within the minimum time requirement, as well as co-supervising a further 1 PhD student to completion.</p>
<p>Dionigi has supervised several Honours students to First Class Honours, and 3 University Medallists. Furthermore, he consistently publishes papers with the postgraduate students that he supervises. Dionigi&rsquo;s reputation as a quality supervisor, and his success rate of timely completions, is attracting Dean's Scholars.</p>
<p>Dionigi has recently engaged with Morgan Stanley and Hall Chadwick (Sydney), who are collaborating with him in both his teaching and research activities. These industries have given him their support to apply for an ARC Linkage grant this year to fund 2 PhD students. The main project is under discussion and refers mainly to innovation in capital markets.</p>
<p>Dionigi has presented his work in peer reviewed international conferences in China (International Conference of Finance - Hong Kong 2010 and Shanghai 2012), and in&nbsp; Europe (European Financial and Management Association in Denmark - 2010 and Portugal - 2011 and International Conference of Finance - Greece 2012 and International Conference of Finance - France 2013/Italy 2014).</p>

Women often deprioritising bushfire preparation in the context of other pressing everyday issues, while societal pressure sees men perform protective roles that many have neither the knowledge nor ability to attempt to fulfil safely; <br />(ii) a firefighting-masculinity that trades on ageism, sexism and homophobia, disputes the worth of women and other types of male firefighters on the fireline with significant consequences for operational procedures and workplace gender equality.<br />&nbsp;<br />The holistic understanding of bushfire vulnerability and resilience developed through Christine's research, has accelerated and legitimised recognition of gender as a key issue affecting bushfire management and safety processes. <br /><br />The research has informed organisational approaches to community engagement, workplace culture, and bushfire management policy and practice, nationally and internationally. It has championed the benefits of gender awareness, equity and equality through a sustained, long-term research commitment that built trust and awareness. <br /><br />As a point of reference in public, policy and media discourses, the research has benefited emergency management and outreach organisations, firefighters, marginalised groups, and communities in fire-affected and at-risk areas.<br /><br />Christine was selected as a World Social Science Risk Interpretation and Action Fellow in 2013, awarded the Australian Research Council's Discovery Early Career Research Award in 2015 and a Discovery Project in 2017, and was named as a UOW Woman of Impact in 2016 as part of the Science in Australia Gender Equity (SAGE) program.<br /><br />
<p><strong>Current Research Projects:<br /></strong><em><strong>Bushfires, faith and community cohesion</strong></em><br /> This project focuses on the affective and embodied experiences of coping and caring narrated by disaster recovery workers in Australia in the context of adapting to extreme but increasingly frequent natural hazard events, such as bushfires. The study extends the concept of the holding environment to disaster geographies. Here, the holding environment comprise the strategies that individuals and groups have developed to cope with risks and exposure, through their embodied responses, and the observed responses of others, to the impact of potential and actual harm. Each component within the holding environment aligns with one of two types of faith, which provide safe spaces (mentally, spiritually, physically and geographically) for disaster recovery workers to confide, grow and heal. These safe spaces, in turn, provide anchor points and sense of purpose. They also accentuate the individual and collective choices we face in terms of mitigating and adapting to changing natural and political climates. An Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Early Career Research Award (DE150101242) funds this project.<br /><br /><strong><em>Gender and Wildfire: Landscapes of uncertainty</em><br /></strong>This project has since 2007 followed women&rsquo;s and men&rsquo;s stories of surviving, fighting, living and working with wildfire in Australia and the American west to reveal the culturally and historically distinct gender relations that underpin coping capacity and resilience. There are a number of outputs listed as publications, YouTube videos and an impact case study on this website.<br /><br /><strong><em>When Disaster Strikes: Under-insurance in an age of volatility</em><br /></strong>There is a growing concern in Australia and internationally of the extensive social and economic costs of disasters, and with it an acknowledgement of our inadequate understanding of the role of insurance in disaster mitigation, preparation and recovery. A 2017 report by Deloitte Access Economics outlined how in the ten years leading up to 2016, the total cost of &lsquo;natural&rsquo; disasters in Australia averaged $18.2 billion per annum.&nbsp;When disasters strike, home and contents insurance provides a safety net but many households are under-insured or not insured at all.&nbsp;The average uninsured loss for each &lsquo;natural&rsquo; disaster in Australia between 2004 and 2011 was estimated by Lloyds at almost $1 billion.&nbsp;Little is known about the factors that contribute to these rates of inadequate insurance cover. This project attempts to bridge this knowledge gap by examining perceptions of risk and insurance amongst residents both with and without direct personal experience of bushfires. It strives to assist the development of insurance policies and implementation strategies that meet the needs of residents. An ARC Discovery Project (DP170100096) with Dr Booth (UTAS), Prof Tranter (UTAS), Ass/Prof French (Uni. of Nottingham) funds this project.</p>","disasters, natural hazards, wildfire / bushfire, vulnerability, resilience, gender, local and Indigenous environmental knowledge, risk engagement and communication"

https://scholars.uow.edu.au/display//caroline_dick,"Dick, Caroline",caroline,,"<p>My thesis research has mainly concentrated the manifestations of sumptuary regulation in Australia from 1901-1927, a period that saw the fabric of Australian society undergo enormous social and political change. Sumptuary regulation is a form of government intervention that seeks to use law and regulatory practices to control the social behaviour and consumption practices of certain sections of society. To date, sumptuary law has been generally characterised as an archaic form of government intervention that targeted the personal lives of people living in the early modern period and has no modern significance. My<strong> innovative research</strong> suggests that the sumptuary impulse has remained resilient and pervasive and has been transfigured into more modern regulatory projects. Whist my thesis research argues that the threads of sumptuary regulation were clearly visible in Australia in the interventionist projects in the early decades following Federation, I contend that this sumptuary impulse still lingers today in Australia and elsewhere under various disguises such as tobacco and alcohol taxes and restrictions.My post-doctoral research continues to focus on these more modern manifestations of sumptuary regulation.</p>
<p><strong>Thesis selected for publication by Oxford University Press</strong></p>
<p>The Australasian Tax Teachers&rsquo; Association announced in January 2017 that Caroline's PhD thesis was selected for publication by the Oxford University Press for 2017. Caroline&rsquo;s thesis - Sumptuary Law by any other name: manifestations of sumptuary regulation in Australia, 1901-1927&ndash; takes a much broader view of &lsquo;taxation&rsquo; than might otherwise be understood and raises important issues about the history and social and economic impact of taxation in Australia.<br /><br />Caroline sought to &lsquo;unpick the past rhetoric of masculinist tariff policy and to repopulate the previously narrow narrative of taxation history by [re]placing women, albeit as victims, within its discourse&rsquo;. Her thesis provides a contemporaneous account of the taxing policies of the post Federation period and highlights the strong symbiotic relationship between taxation and protectionism. It suggests that the imposition of taxation during the period she studied in post Federation Australia until the beginning of the Great Depression, was not just about raising revenue and that it is obvious that projects such as the taxing of public amusements were also undoubtedly clad with the impulse for moral regulation.&nbsp;<br /><br />This highly competitive and prestigious selection is overseen by the Association&rsquo;s Doctoral Series Editorial Board. The selected publication was announced at the conference dinner held of the Association, held this year at the Victoria University of Wellington (New Zealand).</p>",

https://scholars.uow.edu.au/display//bo_li,"Li, Bo",bli,,"<p>My research can be divided into several threads:</p>
<p><strong>DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVEMENT OF LUMINESCENCE DATING TECHNIQUES</strong></p>
<p>My main research area is luminescence dating of sediments using quartz and feldspars. The focus of my research is on developing new luminescence dating techniques and improving them. Over the last decade, I have established several new dating techniques using quartz and feldspars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>APPLICATION OF LUMINESCENCE DATING IN GEOLOGICAL AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL STUDIES</strong></p>
<p>Apart from the development of advanced luminescence dating techniques, my research also involves application of luminescence dating technique to answer important geological and archaeological questions. More recently, I have been more focused on dating key archaeological sites from Asia, Europe and Africa. My research is to develop new luminescence dating techniques and then apply them to these important archaeological and fossil hominin deposits to answer questions about human evolution, dispersals and extinctions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>LUMINESCENCE PROPERTIES OF QUARTZ AND FELDSPAR FROM SEDIMENTS</strong></p>
<p>To achieve the reliable dating task in luminescence dating, fundamental studies on the luminescence properties from quartz and feldspars are necessary. Understanding of the physical features of luminescence signals, such as thermal stability, anomalous fading and kinetics process of charge movements are important for developing reliable dating procedures. Since 2006, I have been studying the luminescence behaviours of quartz and feldspars from various geological settings.<br /><br /></p>",

I also specialise in qualitative housing research, focusing on the economic, cultural and political dimensions of owner-occupation. In 2016, I co-edited the Routledge collection: <em>Housing and Home Unbound: intersections in economics, environment and politics in Australia.</em>","<strong>Urban Geography, Social Movements, Planning, Housing/Home, Post-structural Theories</strong><br /><br /><a href=""mailto:info@theanxietyandstressclinic.com""></a>
<p>My cross-disciplinary research in the field of urban geography, planning and housing reveals the potential of diverse actors and agents to create sustainable and equitable cities and spaces. While this work is grounded in the context of contemporary market societies, my work is fundamentally concerned with charting opportunities for social justice. My two core research themes can be summed up as follows.</p>
<p><strong><i>i) Urban restructuring, urban governance and public participation</i></strong>. Focusing on planning policy, urban governance, community activism and public participation, my research examines the nature and boundary of urban social justice in cities. Rsearch outputs on this theme are advancing a new understanding of the city based on emergence and innovation within urban systems. Broadly grouped under the rubric of assemblage, this work bridges the gap between theories of social movements and political philosophies of emergence and becoming.</p>
<p><strong>ii) <i>The economy and culture of housing and home.</i></strong> I have also examined home-ownership, attachment to home and housing wealth in the context of deregulated mortgage markets and house price appreciation in the United Kingdom and Australia. The outputs of this research &mdash;which lie at the interface of the culture and economy of housing and home&mdash;bring an in-depth understanding of the emotional, practical and financial values home-owners attach to consumer (and other) goods and services purchased by borrowing against the home. By integrating financial and social elements of home, this work provides new insights into the geographies of home and housing wealth; as well as broader neighbhourhood dynamics in diverse cities. I am currently examining the ways that owner-occupiers' attachments to home shape the densification frontier in Australian cities.</p>
<p>I have also recently co-edited the new Routledge text <i>Housing and Home Unbound </i>that explores the political, economic and environmental context of human dwelling in Australia. This work emerged through the 2013 Institution of Australian Geographers&rsquo; (IAG) conference of the same name, with Louise Crabtree and Aidan Davison. The book explores the social dimensions of housing through an analysis of the unique political and economic context of Australian housing and attachments to home, including its colonial, market-based and welfare traditions.</p>",

In subsequent research, I retained this nexus of concerns but shifted historical and national focus&nbsp; to 20th and 21st-century America. My first book, <em>Queer Commodities: Contemporary US Fiction, Consumer Capitalism, and Gay and Lesbian Subcultures</em> (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012)&nbsp; is the first substantial analysis of same-sexuality and consumer capitalism in contemporary US fiction. It moves beyond&nbsp; critical tendencies to identify gay and lesbian subcultures as either hopelessly immersed in consumer capitalism or heroically resistant to it,&nbsp; arguing that while these subcultures are necessarily commodified, they also provide means of subversively negotiating aspects of life under capitalism. In my second book, <em>Categorically Famous: Literary Celebrity and Sexual Liberation in 1960s America</em>&nbsp;(in production, Stanford University Press), I argue that the work and public images of three famous authors, James Baldwin, Susan Sontag, and Gore Vidal, significantly contributed to the greater openness about homosexuality that characterised the 1960s and that was an important precondition of the gay and lesbian liberation. Consideration of these three writers&rsquo; careers, I contend, makes it necessary to rethink the anti-liberationist bias within queer studies, whereby gay and lesbian visibility is understood as a form of social control.​",

Croft&rsquo;s research addresses the relative safety of such exposure, with the aim being to ensure that in our rush to utilise the benefits of wireless communication, we are not unwittingly being harmed by it.</p>
<p>Following on from undergraduate degrees in philosophy and psychology, Croft's PhD tested and developed algorithms for removing artefact from the electroencephalograph, a technique used to assess neural function. This led to postdoctoral research that tested for effects of mobile phone-related electromagnetic fields on neural function, which extended into mobile phone-related health more generally. Such &lsquo;bioelectromagnetic&rsquo; research is now the focus of Croft&rsquo;s work, where, in addition to further exploring the effects of electromagnetic fields on human neural and sleep function, his work now extends to cancer epidemiology, animal models of neurodegenerative disease, cellular models to explore mechanisms, and, due to the mild temperature elevation caused by these electromagnetic fields, thermal physiology more generally.</p>

<p><i>Statistical treatment of OSL data, especially for fluvial sediment</i></p>
<p>Fluvial sediment can contain useful information on recent environmental change and human impacts. Reading this archive requires a good chronology, for which Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) could be revolutionary. However, fluvial sediment is not ideal for OSL dating, because the mineral grains used for dating need to have been exposed to sunlight prior to their deposition. I use signal analysis and computational statistics to extend the boundaries of OSL dating, aiming to create an accurate and precise dating method for young fluvial sediment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Modelling the radiation dose to grains in natural sediment</i></p>
<p>Mineral grains in natural sediment receive a radiation dose from their surroundings, and this dose is used to estimate their age through OSL. Adjacent grains may receive different radiation doses, because of the heterogeneous distribution of radionuclides in the sediment. By quantifying this process, we will be able to account for it better in the dating calculations, leading to improved precision of OSL ages. I tackle this issue using radiation transport software and innovative experimental methods.</p>

After graduating from Cambridge in 1988 with a degree in Religious Studies, Mark spent the next two years in Japan as a Monbusho scholar affiliated with the Sociology Department at the University of Tokyo where he researched New Religious Movements in Japan. In the early 90s he engaged with further Japanese language studies at the University of Sheffield before undertaking a PhD in Japanese Studies at the University of Hong Kong.&nbsp;<br /><br />Mark has held teaching and research positions in Australia, Japan and the U.S. where he was the 2007/08 Toyota Visiting Professor of Japanese at the University of Michigan. His pioneering work on the history of sexual minority cultures in Japan has been the topic of invited presentations at universities in the U.S., the U.K., Singapore, Canada, Australia&nbsp;and Japan. <br /><br />Mark serves on a number of scholarly and advisory bodies including a three-year term on the Australian Research Council's (ARC) College of Experts (2015-18). He has also served as an expert reader for the ARC Discovery Grants scheme and the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong. He supports research into gender and sexuality studies in an Asian context through serving on the advisory boards of Hong Kong University Press' ""Queer Asia"" book series as well as the advisory boards of the journals <em>Sexualities</em>&nbsp;and <em>Porn Studies.</em>","<p>Mark is a sociologist and cultural historian of Japan specialising in the history of sexuality, gender theory and new media. His recent publications have focused on the postwar history of Japanese cultures of sexuality and the development of the Internet in Japan, especially the use of the Internet and other new media by minority communities in Japan and throughout Asia.</p>
<p>Mark recently completed an ARC-funded Future Fellowship Project entitled ""National Media Regulation and Global Cultural Literacy: International Perspectives on the Regulation of Young People&rsquo;s User-Generated Content"". The project looked at how the transformation of communication via networked digital media has led to a blurring between media producers and users, especially with regard to a case study of fans of Japanese manga and anime. The project&nbsp;led to the Routledge volume <em>The End of Cool Japan: Ethical, Legal and Cultural Challenges to Japanese Popular Culture,</em> described as ""offer[ing]&nbsp; readers&nbsp; a seminal&nbsp; and&nbsp; outstanding&nbsp; examination&nbsp; into&nbsp; the&nbsp; problematic&nbsp; aspects&nbsp; of researching, studying, and teaching topics related to Japanese popular culture today"" in <em>Mutual</em> <em>Images Journal.</em></p>
<p>Another recently completed ARC project was <em>Internet History in Australia and the Asia-Pacific</em> which compared the development and uses of the Internet in Australia, with those of China, Korea, and Japan. One outcome from the project was the <em>Routledge Companion to Global Internet Histories</em>, co-edited with Gerard Goggin. Mark is on the editorial board of the new journal <em>Internet Histories</em> and on the advisory board of<em> Asiascape: Digital Asia</em>.&nbsp;He is enthusiastic about supporting research into Japan's early ""pre-Web"" internet cultures and is interested&nbsp;in the history of the non-Anglophone Internet in general.&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>Sexuality and Social Transformation in Japan</em>&nbsp;is an ongoing research&nbsp;interest that considers how global movements of people and knowledge are impacting upon Japanese constructs of sexuality and gender. Major publications from this project include the book <em>Queer Japan from the Pacific War to the Internet Age</em>, described in the<em> Journal of the History of Sexuality</em> as ""a richly detailed history of sexual subcultures in postwar Japan&nbsp;. . .&nbsp; even in Japanese there is no work with a comparable scope or depth of analysis"". This was followed by <em>Love, Sex and Democracy in Japan during the American Occupation</em>, described in <em>The Journal of the History of Sexuality</em> as ""mak[ing] available to the general reader the vast trove of source material on early postwar Japanese sexual culture"". The latest (2018) output from this project is an essay on Japanese sexologist Takahashi Tetsu&nbsp;in the University of California Press collection <em>A Global History of Sexual Science</em>.<br /><br />Mark's interest in sexuality and sexual minority culture in Japan and East Asia also&nbsp;recently resulted in the <em>Routledge Handbook of Sexuality Studies in East Asia</em>, co-edited with Vera Mackie and a co-edited volume looking at women fans of ""boys' love"" (BL) media entitled <em>Boys Love Manga and Beyond: History, Community and Culture in Japan, </em>described in <em>Mechademia </em>journal as ""a foundational text for rethinking and broadening critical perspectives that have for too long been solely informed by western engagements with identity politics"". <br /><br />Mark is currently working on a follow-on volume to his book on sexuality during the American Occupation of Japan, provisionally entitled<em> Liberal Sexology in Postwar Japan </em>which focuses on discourses of sexuality developed in a range of coterie magazines published in Japan in the 1950s and 60s.</p>",

<li>A critical analysis of health education policy and public pedagogies associated with health promotion and prevention</li>
</ul>
<p>My research draws on feminist and post-structuralist theory to critically engage issues associated with the body, health and physical activity. In all my work there has been a close attention to the body as central to subjectivity and as necessary to an understanding of the self. This theme has been taken up in studies of movement-based pedagogies and published papers examining media constructions of gender and physical activity.</p>
<p>I am committed to making a difference to the ways the subject, physical and health education, is conceived in curriculum and policy and how it is taught in schools.</p>

https://scholars.uow.edu.au/display//helen_georgiou,"Georgiou, Helen",helengeo,,"Dr Helen Georgiou is a lecturer in science education and former high school physics teacher. 

Helen’s research focuses on how to describe and develop student understanding in science, particularly in areas which consistently cause problems for students. Her PhD, from The University of Sydney, looked at student understanding of thermodynamics and is entitled ‘Doing Positive Work: on student understanding of thermodynamics’.

A unique element of Helen’s current research involves drawing from an epistemological framework known as Legitimation Code Theory to explore the nature of scientific knowledge in various educational contexts. This approach is able to make certain knowledge claims and practices more explicit, reducing the risk of misunderstanding and disengagement in science. 

Other research interests include diagnosing misconceptions, assessing new instructional techniques, and analysing student explanations. She also has an interest in female representation in science (particularly physics) and professional learning through peer observation (in higher education).

<p>My research interests lie in the area of geomorphology, and I am particularly interested in applying a range of cosmogenic nuclide-based methods to study the interactions between surface processes, tectonics, and climate. My current focus is on quantifying surface process rates and sediment residence times in rivers using cosmogenic in situ carbon-14 (i.e., radiocarbon produced in-situ in rocks). Method development is integral to my research and I have been involved in the development of cosmogenic in situ carbon-14 extraction systems at SUERC and Cologne University.</p>
<p>I have substantial experience in working with in situ cosmogenic Be-10, C-14, and Al-26, as well as other dating techniques such as Radiocarbon, OSL/PSL.</p>",

My lab uses social fishes from both marine and freshwater environments as model species to test key hypotheses related to the evolution of conflict, cooperation, group-living and mating systems. The techniques we use range from&nbsp;observational and experimental approaches in the field, genetic and phylogenetic analyses, and physiological assessments of underlying proximate mechanisms in the laboratory. We are also interested in understanding the impacts of abiotic stressors on the behaviour of social fishes and how this impacts higher levels of their social organisation. Therefore, my lab draws on a wide variety of techniques to address both pure and applied questions in behavioural ecology. I welcome any enquiries from prospective undergraduates, postgraduates, post-docs and collaborators who may be interested in these lines of research.",,

<p>Following an early distinguished career in Physics, I became attracted to the evolution of digital technologies and transferred to the discipline of Information Systems (IS) when I moved to Wollongong in 1986.&nbsp; I am now an internationally recognised senior scholar in IS and the related fields of Knowledge Management (KM) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Research topics in these 3 fields are interconnected, multidisciplinary, socio-technical and globally important.&nbsp; In my membership of the Association for Information Systems (AIS), the international body for IS academics, I provide service to the discipline with other leaders in the field, establishing the Special Interest Group in Green IS, chairing the AIS Outreach Task Force&nbsp; and editing special issues of journals in the AIS basket.</p>
<p>The discipline of IS encompasses future-focused and fast-moving topics related to the development, use and impact of digital technologies. I have demonstrated expertise in researching topics known as&nbsp;<i>Grand Challenges</i>&nbsp;by<i>&nbsp;</i>taking a holistic investigative approach with innovative theories and methods. As significant citations to many of my papers show, I am internationally recognised as an authority on Activity and Complexity Theories as well as interpretive qualitative methodologies that are appropriate for applying these theories in cross-disciplinary.&nbsp; I received the VC's Award for Interdisciplinary Research Excellence in 2015 and for Community Engagement in 2017.</p>
<p>Among the Grand Challenges on which my research projects focus<i>,&nbsp;</i>I am known internationally for leadership in the new field of Green IS and for expertise on Strategic Information Systems for Complex Decision Support (my PhD topic). Nationally, I am known for my action research on the use of computers by the elderly to improve their independence and wellbeing. I plan to commercialise this program as a Social Business service to isolated elderly in the community through iAccelerate.</p>
<p>I have demonstrated expertise in research management bringing in $578,509 in competitive research grants and $192,364 in research consulting. I was lead CI on two ARC Discovery funded projects which involved a partnership with DSTO with impact on the Department of Defence. I also have long standing cooperative engagement with Standards Australia and CSIRO. I have presented seminars and workshops at IS Schools in Australian and in the USA, UK, Germany, Lichtenstein, the Middle East and Asia. I have given Keynotes at 5 national and 1 international conferences.</p>
<p>I have been employed at UOW for 30 years developing my research impact and leadership capability. Over this time I have positively influenced the careers of 100s of staff whom I have mentored and HDR students whom I have supervised. I continue to work with many former IS staff and students. 10 of my journal articles and 17 conference papers are co-authored with my former HDR students. Some of my 30 completed HDR graduates are now professors themselves at universities in many countries including the Australian G8.&nbsp; At UOW I am regularly nominated for supervisor of the year and, in 2012, received the VC's award for HDR Supervision Excellence.</p>

https://scholars.uow.edu.au/display//aidan_sims,"Sims, Aidan D. ",asims,"I am broadly interested in functional analysis, more specifically in the area of operator algebras and its applications in related fields. Much of my research is concerned with&nbsp;<i>C*</i>-algebras associated to directed graphs, to higher-rank graphs and to other combinatorial structures. These can be regarded as special cases of the theory of&nbsp;<i>C*</i>-algebras associated to Hilbert bimodules and to product systems of Hilbert bimodules, and I have a long-standing interest in these as well. More recently I have developed interests in&nbsp;<i>C*</i>-algebras associated to groupoids and to Fell bundles over groupoids, and also to the interplay between operator algebras and algebraic topology: in particular in Dixmier&ndash;Douady theory and in deformations of&nbsp;<i>C*</i>-algebras by cohomological data. I have also recently developed research programs studying the structure of equilibrium states, known as KMS states, of&nbsp;<i>C*</i>-dynamical systems; particularly in the context of&nbsp;<i>C*</i>-algebras associated to combinatorial structures. I am a professor of pure mathematics in the School of Mathematics &amp; Applied Statistics, which belongs to the Faculty of Engineering and Information Sciences, and am a member of the Institute for Noncommutative Analysis (INCA), a research centre of the University of Wollongong's Institute for Mathematics and Its Applications.","<p>My general area of research is in mathematics, specifically in the areas of functional analysis, operator algebras, and noncommutative geometry. More specifically, I study C*-algebras. These infinite-dimensional analogues of matrix algebras first arose out of efforts in the 1930's and 1940's to provide a mathematical framework for quantum mechanics. These days C*-algebra theory is a very active area of mathematical research in its own right, and enjoys deep connections with other areas of mathematics such as symbolic dynamics, ergodic theory, group theory and even number theory. It also remains relevant to mathematical physics through noncommutative geometry and through applications of K-theory to the study of topological phases of matter.</p>
<p>I am particularly interested in studying C*-algebras associated to combinatorial objects like directed graphs, to algebraic objects like groupoids, and to analytic objects like Hilbert bimodules. Generally speaking I'm interested in understanding how to represent a given class of algebraic or combinatorial objects C*-algebraically, and investigating how the structural features of the resulting C*-algebras relate to the properties of the generating objects. Some of my key interests are in computing the primitive-ideal structure and regularity properties (for example, quasidiagonality, pure infiniteness and nuclear dimension) of these sorts of C*-algebras.</p>
<p>I am also interested in understanding C*-algebraic representations of dynamical systems; in particular in characterising the KMS equilibrium states of C*-dynamical systems.</p>
<p>My research interests also include purely algebraic analogues of groupoid algebras, and in the extent to which groupoid models can explain the striking parallels between the algebraic and analytic theories.<br /><br />A full list of my articles and preprints is available on the arXiv at&nbsp;https://arxiv.org/a/0000-0002-1965-6451.html</p>",Topology | Combinatorics | Analysis | Algebra | KMS state | Mathematics | Functional Analysis | groupoid | Pure mathematics | C*-algebra

https://scholars.uow.edu.au/display//robert_barry,"Barry, Robert J.",rbarry,,"<p>My research program is focused on four interacting themes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Orienting Reflex</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is my first and major scientific interest, using the Orienting Reflex (OR) as a model of stimulus-response processes in perception and cognition.&nbsp; After my early work indicated that the OR was <i>not</i> a unitary phenomenon, I have been developing <i>Preliminary Process Theory</i>, a sequential processing theory of the psychophysiology of the OR.&nbsp; This has been published in a number of developmental versions, including most recently in a special-issue paper on habituation (<strong>Barry</strong>, 2009b).&nbsp; Recent activities in this area have been focussed on extending the theory to accommodate event-related potentials and understanding the sequential processing reflected in ERPs relevant to the OR, such as the Novelty P3 (see <strong>Barry</strong> et al., in press).&nbsp; A series of papers developing a schema for sequential processing in the equiprobable Go/NoGo task has helped to strengthen my authority in the ERP context.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Electrophysiology of AD/HD</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is my applied area, concentrating on using electrophysiology to obtain a better understanding of AD/HD.&nbsp; Some years ago I extended my activities into a private clinic focused on objective electrophysiological assessment in AD/HD, and subsequently started a number of PhD students in this area, including Johnstone (working on ERPs), and Clarke (working on EEG).&nbsp; These are now both Associate Professors in this School, and much of my work in this area is in collaboration with them and their students (e.g., Robbie et al., 2016). &nbsp;Together we have made major contributions to the global understanding of this disorder in both children and adults.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arousal and Activation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This work aims at the clarification of the energetic aspects of behaviour.&nbsp; Leading theories of the OR see the current arousal state as providing an &ldquo;amplifier&rdquo; for physiological responses.&nbsp; From early work (<strong>Barry </strong>&amp; Sokolov, 1993), I have developed electrodermal skin conductance level as the &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; measure of arousal, and linked this to EEG alpha activity.&nbsp; This has been useful in exploring models of AD/HD (e.g., <strong>Barry </strong>et al., 2009), and has been funded by ARC.&nbsp; Our arousal/activation perspective is illustrated in VaezMousavi et al. (2009).&nbsp; Current work on EEG changes from eyes-closed to eyes-open resting conditions from childhood to older adults is expanding notions of reactivity and compensatory brain function in healthy older adults and may provide benchmarks to explore early aspects of loss in Alzheimer&rsquo;s dementia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brain Dynamics</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>My interest in brain dynamics developed with access to digital signal processing systems in Wollongong.&nbsp; It spans a number of aspects relating prestimulus EEG activity to ERP outcomes, exploring mechanisms of ERP genesis (e.g., <strong>Barry</strong>, 2009a).&nbsp; In particular, my main focus has been on adaptive phase changes, with demonstrations that, in studies with repetitive stimuli, the brain organises its ongoing activity to generate preferred phase states at stimulus onset, which optimise stimulus processing and its ERP outcomes (see <strong>Barry</strong> et al., 2014).&nbsp; I am currently working with variable ISIs to avoid this phenomenon and explore EEG phase effects in isolation.</p>",

In 2017 this iconic Australian coastal landscape underwent a second consecutive mass bleaching event. Driven by carbon emissions and global practices of consumption, this environmental issue represents a truly global challenge.<br /><br /><strong>Hope and&nbsp;Grief in the Geography classroom<br /></strong>Human geography courses frequently touch on distressing material: the inevitability of climate change, food insecurity, the plight of refugees and asylum seekers, and child labour, to name a few. Discussions of how to communicate such information in the public sphere have garnered some attention, with concerns being raised that a &lsquo;doom and gloom&rsquo; approach may be disempowering and counterproductive. This project (with Natascha Klocker, Charlie Gillon, Jenny Atchison and Gordon Waitt) engages the existing evidence base around strategies for communicating challenging issues, bringing the focus to the undergraduate classroom.<br /><br /><strong>A Love of County: mapping and re-imagining a UOW Geography curriculum<br /></strong>This project, funded by a University of Wollongong Jindaola Indigenous Knowledge grant, creates an opportunity for colleagues in the School of Geography and Sustainable Communities to pay attention, explicitly and carefully, to the ways that geographic knowledge is produced and practiced, and to further embed Indigenous knowledges and perspectives into the curriculum. Working with Laura Hammersley, Vanessa Cavanagh, Jenny Atchison, Chantel Carr, Gillian Gregory and Michael Adams, and PhD students Carrie Wilkinson, Hilton Penfold and Craig Lyons, we seek to engage our whole of School to map the existing UOW geography curriculum and rethink how we can support our students to effectively and respectfully engage with Indigenous knowledges across our teaching.</p>
